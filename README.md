# FreeCADScripts
A variety of Python scripts I've written for use with FreeCAD

## Arc Slot
Arc Slot is to be used in an open sketch and will create a constrained, arced slot.
Optionally, it can be self constrained (that is it will move as a whole, with geometry and constraints) or
the same but constrained to a vertex selected bt the use before the executing the script.
The script displays a dialog where the user must enter the values of the slot radius and width.

## Rounded Rectangle
Rounded Rectangle is to be used in an open sketch and will create a constrained, rectangle with rounded corners.
Optionally, it can be self constrained (that is it will move as a whole, with geometry and constraints) or
the same but constrained to a vertex selected bt the use before the executing the script.
The script displays a dialog where the user must enter the values of the rectangle height, witdh, and corner radius.

## Installation
[Macros directory](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/How_to_install_macros#Macros_directory "Macros directory")



## Known issues:
* The location of the icon used in the dialog is currently hard coded and must be modified by the user to reflect the location
of the icon on system.
